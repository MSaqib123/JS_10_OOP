//====================== What is OOP ====================
//=======================================================
//1. OOP is programming paradigm based on the concept of object  (paradigm = style_Of_Code write and organize code)
//2. We use objects to model (describe) real-world(users  or todolist)  or  abstract(htmlComponent or data structure) features
//3. Object may contains data (properties) and code (methods). by using object , we pack DATA and Behaviours into one Big Block
//4. in OOP, objects are self-contained pieces/blocks of code
//5. Object are building Block of application and interect with another
//6. Interactions happen through public interfaces (API): methods that the code OUTSIDE of the object can access and use to communicate with the object


//=======================================================
//====================== Why OOOP =======================
//=======================================================
//==== Spaghetti Code ====
// OOP was developerd with  goal of Organization code , to make it more flexible and easier to maintain 

//==== Spaghetti Code ====
//to  avoide  bad code (we called developing term  Spaghetti code)

//OOP is structured Code Style (Paragigm = Style)


//=======================================================
//================== Class and Instances ================
//=======================================================
//__________ 1. Classs _________
//Class ====> Blue Print (Plane)    (NOT a physical thing)
//To Create New Object(Instance)=====> we Used   Class  (physical thing)
//Exp:  ArchtectureMap of Building Plane (NOT Physicall)  to  Build a real Building (Physical)

//__________ 2. Instances _________
//after Create Class  => we Use Instance To Create Object (Instance = Object)

//Examp 1 :   Building Archecuter  --> from Archtecture we build Room ,Washroom, kitchen, Balkanii
//So Archeture is Class Blue print  ====> After Building Real Building the Room and ketchn are Instance of that Building Object

//Examp 2 :   Person is Object (Blue Print)   
//Instance()   --> Student  , Employeee , BusinessMan , .....

//=======================================================
//================= Note Importent thing ================
//=======================================================
//JS does not Support Real Classes Like other language 
//JS Class  are NOt As The  other programing  language its  FACK Classs Sytnax
//in background  JS code converted to normal Function 

//====> JS oop is   (syntactic Sugar)
